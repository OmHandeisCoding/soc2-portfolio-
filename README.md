Service Organisations Control 2 Audit (SOC-2) Audit Work 


What is SOC 2?

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an independent assurance report developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It evaluates how a service organization designs and operates controls to protect customer data and systems.

SOC 2 assessments are based on the Trust Services Criteria (TSC), which include:

Security (mandatory)

Availability

Confidentiality

Processing Integrity

Privacy

Unlike ISO 27001, SOC 2 is not a certification. It is an attestation report issued by a licensed CPA firm, providing customers with assurance that appropriate controls are in place and operating effectively.

SOC 2 is widely required by:

SaaS companies

Cloud service providers

FinTechs

B2B technology vendors

Data processors handling sensitive customer data

What These Projects Demonstrate

This repository demonstrates practical, end-to-end SOC 2 capability, covering the full lifecycle of a real-world engagement.

Specifically, these projects show the ability to:

Translate SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria into implementable controls

Design a SOC 2 readiness program from scratch

Create auditor-ready artifacts such as:

Control matrices

Policies and procedures

Risk registers

Evidence checklists

Map cloud infrastructure (AWS) to SOC 2 requirements

Apply the shared responsibility model in a compliance context

Simulate audit-grade evidence including:

Access requests and approvals

Change management records

Incident response documentation

Think from an auditor’s perspective, focusing on:

Control ownership

Consistency

Traceability

Risk-based decision-making

The projects are structured exactly as they would be in a consulting or in-house security/compliance role.

Simulated but Auditor-Accurate SOC 2 Program

This repository represents a simulated SOC 2 program, created for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes.

Important clarifications:

❌ This is not an official SOC 2 audit

❌ No CPA firm has issued a SOC 2 report for this repository

❌ This does not claim SOC 2 certification or compliance

However:

✅ The controls, artifacts, and workflows are aligned with AICPA Trust Services Criteria

✅ The structure mirrors real SOC 2 Type I and Type II engagements

✅ Evidence examples reflect what auditors typically request and test

✅ Control design follows industry-standard audit expectations

The intent is to demonstrate audit readiness, control design maturity, and SOC 2 operational understanding, not to replace a formal audit.
