# SOC 2 Portfolio  
**Service Organization Control (SOC 2) – Practical Audit & Readiness Work**

This repository is a **hands-on SOC 2 portfolio** designed to demonstrate how SOC 2 is implemented, assessed, and operated in real-world service organizations—beyond theory and checklists.

## 🔐 What is SOC 2?

**SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2)** is an independent assurance report developed by the **American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)**. It evaluates how effectively a service organization **designs and operates controls** to protect customer data and systems.

SOC 2 assessments are based on the **Trust Services Criteria (TSC):**

- **Security** *(mandatory)*
- **Availability**
- **Confidentiality**
- **Processing Integrity**
- **Privacy**

> 💡 Unlike ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2 is **not a certification**.  
> It is an **attestation report** issued by a licensed CPA firm, based on evidence collected and tested during an audit period.
